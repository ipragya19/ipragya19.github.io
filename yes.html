    <h1>My Valentine,</h1>

    <p class="message">
      Thank you for saying yes.  
      Your response has been recorded, acknowledged, and stored safely in my heart.
      <br><br>
      Now just wait — and be prepared for a Valentine’s Day
      that’s thoughtfully planned, slightly nerdy,
      and completely about you.
    </p>

    <p class="from">
      — Yours, Bharat ❤️
